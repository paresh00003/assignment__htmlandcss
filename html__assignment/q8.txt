Q.> In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page?

1> Inline CSS: You can add CSS directly to HTML elements using the style attribute.

2> Internal CSS: You can include CSS code within the <style> tags in the 
<head> section of your HTML document.

3> External CSS: You can create a separate CSS file with a .
css extension and link it to your HTML document using the <link> tag.
